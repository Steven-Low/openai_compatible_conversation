### OpenAI-Compatible Conversation
This repository is a modified and bug-fixed version of the original project. 

### Notes about Conversation History
- Using this integration with Wyoming Assist (from (HassMic)[https://github.com/jeffc/hassmic]) will **not** reset the conversation history unless this integration is reloaded or home assistant is restarted.
> **Note**  
> The token increase is only around 50 tokens for continuous conversation, so relax ðŸ˜„.
